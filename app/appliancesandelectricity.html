    Inefficient usage of appliances and electricity can increase your carbon footprint substantially.
     To prevent this, you can begin by unplugging electronics when they are not in use, and managing the use of certain devices efficiently.
     This can be demonstrated by the use of LED light bulbs over bulbs that are less efficient, such as incandescent bulbs.
     LED bulbs use 85% less energy than incandescent bulbs, and last almost 25 times longer, saving much more energy.
     Another way to start is by purchasing appliances that are more energy-efficient. You can find these appliances by looking for the 
     <i>Energy Star</i> logo (image below), which is a government-ran system that is used for the identification of energy-efficient products.

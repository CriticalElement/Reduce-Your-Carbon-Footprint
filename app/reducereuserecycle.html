    <p class="text animation">
        Reducing, reusing, and recycling are 3 small actions that can greatly reduce your carbon footprint. It is important to recycle as it decresases the amount of materials going into landfils and incinerators, which greatly adds to global CO2 amounts. Materials such as plastic, paper, glass, and
        carboard can be recycled. Additionally,
        <i>cleaned</i> empty food containers can be recycled. Recycled materials can be used to create other products such as newspapers, and plastic bottles. It is also important to reduce the amount of household waste. You can do this by purchasing goods
        in bulk and using reusable bags. You can also buy products that use less packaging to reduce the amount of trash. Finally, it is important to reuse materials. You can reuse previously bought products such as birthday decorations, christmas lights,
        water bottles, and plastic bags.

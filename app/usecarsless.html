<h1 class="title animation">How to Reduce Your Carbon Footrpint by Using Cars Less
    <p class="text animation">
        Cars are one of the biggest contributors to CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. Therefore, by using cars less your carbon 
        footprint will decrease substantially. If you normally ride a car to your school or university, consider 
        walking or cycling. However, if you live far away or using a car is unavoidable, try to drive more efficiently. 
        Consider shutting off the engine in places where you would be idling the longest, such as carpool lanes. Or, 
        you could even carpool with other people such as family and friends, therefore using cars less and reducing 
        your carbon footprint. You can also consider using public transportation more, such as city buses.
